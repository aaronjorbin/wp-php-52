This creates a local WP install including the beta tester plugin on PHP 5.2. I am using it to make sure it won't let me upgrade to WP 5.2 when I am on PHP 5.2

`docker-compose up -d` and then head to http://localhost:8888

This isn't really a maintained project, but no reason for this code to only live on my computer.
